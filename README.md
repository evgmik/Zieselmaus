# Zieselmaus

A fast, elegant and modern Gopher Client for Android. Forked from
[rtyler/Zieselmaus](https://github.com/rtyler/Zieselmaus) which is itself the fork of
[afonsotrepa/PocketGopher](https://github.com/afonsotrepa/PocketGopher)


### Features

* A Tiny client based on material design, with a Dark theme.
* Bookmarks and History for intuitive navigation.
* Modular support for Video, Sound, HTML and Text files (and more in future updates).
* Ability to easily edit URLs on the fly, unlike other clients.
* Designed for the modern Android ecosystem, with fluid interaction.
* Ad free.

### Installation

This fork from [rtyler/Zieselmaus](https://github.com/rtyler/Zieselmaus) compiles on Debian Trixie with  OpenJDK Java runtime v21.
Also the compiled apk runs on Android v16 while both [rtyler/Zieselmaus](https://github.com/rtyler/Zieselmaus) and [afonsotrepa/PocketGopher](https://github.com/afonsotrepa/PocketGopher) refused to install.

Note: when apk installed manually (via direct download) only  the 'debug' version works.
I do not know why, but the 'release' version refuses to install.

### License

The original Pocket Gopher source was released into the public domain. All
subsequent changes are made under the GPLv3 license however.
