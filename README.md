### Installation

This fork from 'rtyler/Zieselmaus' compiles on Debian Trixie with  OpenJDK Java runtime v21.
Also the compiled apk runs on Android v16 while both [rtyler/Zieselmaus] and [afonsotrepa/PocketGopher] refused to install.

Note: when apk installed manually (via direct download) only 'debug' version works.
I do not know why, yet to be investigated, but 'release' version refuses to install.
